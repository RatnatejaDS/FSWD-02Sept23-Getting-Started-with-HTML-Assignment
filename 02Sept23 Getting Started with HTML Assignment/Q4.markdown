Write a short note on Tag and element with an example

In HTML , "tags" and "elements" are fundamental concepts used to structure and define the content of a web page

**HTML Tags:**
    1. A tag is a fundamental building block in HTML. It consists of angle brackets (< and >) and is used to define elements within an HTML document.
    2. Tags are used to mark the beginning and end of an element. They are enclosed in angle brackets, and most come in pairs (an opening tag and a closing tag).
    3. Tags are not visible on the webpage; they are used to structure and describe the content.

**Element:**
    1. An element consists of one or more tags and the content they enclose. It represents a specific part of the webpage, such as text, images, links, or structural elements like headings or paragraphs.
    2. Elements are the actual components that make up a webpage's content and can be seen by users when they view the webpage in a web browser.
    3. Elements are created by using opening and closing tags, with the content placed between them.

**Example:**
    Here's an example of an HTML tag and element:
        <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>

    In this example:
        1. <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag.
        2. Together, <p> and </p> define a paragraph element.
        3. "This is a paragraph element." is the content of the paragraph element.

When rendered in a web browser, this HTML code will display the text "This is a paragraph element." as a paragraph on the webpage.

So, in summary, tags are used to define elements, and elements represent the actual content that users see on a webpage. HTML documents are constructed by combining various elements using tags to create a structured and visually appealing web page.
